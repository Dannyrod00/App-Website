        App Academy Computer Science courses are 100% project based, and follow the “flipped classroom” pedagogical model, where lessons are                 recorded and delivered through video format with companion written resources. The “flipped classroom” pedagogical model enables students to         learn new concepts and syntax at their own pace, and focus on project development by collaborating with their peers and under the guidance           of the instructor in the classroom.

            Students begin with creating a three-page, responsive portfolio website to showcase their future projects. Students learn JavaScript               and PHP programming to add interactivity to their web applications and develop their own games. The progression of projects equips                 students with the skills necessary to succeed in continued academic study in university computer science programs and the professional             industry of software development alike. The Web Development two-year sequence culminates with the students building a series of object-             oriented, database driven web applications using skills acquired through previous projects.
